# Configuration settings for various environments and machines

## Instructions to clone directory
* "git init" (in home directory)
* "git remote add origin git@github.com:jsreese92/dotfiles.git"
* set up rsa key as explained here: https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
* git pull origin master

## Machines currently synced
* My MacbookPro
* Windows VM at work running Cygwin
* Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop VM at work

## TODO
* Write script to create necessary directories and pull from repositories I'm using
to set up a new machine more easily
  * an example of this is setting up .backup and .swp directories in .vim
